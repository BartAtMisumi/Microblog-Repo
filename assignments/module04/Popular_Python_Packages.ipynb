    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will work with the material you learned in Module 4, packages scripts, such as the `Numpy` and `pandas` libraries. You will learn how to import packages and how to use their functions. You will also test your knowledge on 1D and 2D `NumPy` arrays. In the second half of the assignment, you will be asked to work with DataFrames.  You will be asked to create DataFrames and to select dataseries. Finally, you will be asked to filter the data in a DataFrame and compute basic statistic on its entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to build your familiarity and comfort coding in Python while also helping you review key topics from each module. As you progress through the assignment, answers will get increasingly complex. It is important that you adopt a data scientist's mindset when completing this assignment. Remember to run your code from each cell before submitting your assignment. Running your code beforehand will notify you of errors and give you a chance to fix them before submitting. You should view your Vocareum submission as if you are delivering a final project to your manager or client.\n",

    "**Vocareum Tips**\n",
    "   - Do not add arguments or options to functions unless you are specifically asked to. This will cause an error in Vocareum.\n",
    "   - Do not use a library unless you are expicitly asked to in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    " - Import and use packages in Python and Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    " - Distinguish between NumPy arrays and lists. \n",
    " - Use NumPy functions for basic statistical analyses. \n",
    " - Practice filtering and slicing DataFrames with pandas. "
