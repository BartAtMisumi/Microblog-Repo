    "The population of the United States is **330 million**. It is practically impossible to send a survey to every individual to gather information. Instead, we can identify a sample of **1 million** people using probability sampling to collect data. Sending a survey to 1 million people identified as our sample will help us question a set of citizens that are representative of the broader population and will limit the potential for bias in our sample.\n",
